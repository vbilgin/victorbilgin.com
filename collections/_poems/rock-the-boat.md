- Rock the boat,
- spill the sand,
- Marcy is dying.
- Her back wet with sweat,
- her hair fiery red.
- She's fighting for her life,
- draped beside me.
- It's a funny thing,
- dying,
- the final loss,
- the final word,
- the final joke.
- It's the cat with no fur,
- the car with no gas.
- It's what we dread most,
- the thing that comes fast.
- She's dying, alright.
- With a smile on her face,
- an eye on this world,
- and one on the next.
