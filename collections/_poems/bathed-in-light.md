- Her body bathed in light
- of manic passion, so bright,
- as thoughts escaped her form,
- and offered truths yet unborn.

- Out of sight, she danced and swirled,
- in a bedeviled, frenzied world.
- Her feet, so pale and tired,
- yet her mind still inspired.

- When time came for us to meet,
- she slipped into calm, serene sleep.
- Though I knew not her name,
- her pain I saw just the same -
- blinding in its shine and shame.
